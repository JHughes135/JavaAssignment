2nd Year Java Assignment, Language Analyser

This program reads a piece of text from a txt file and determines whether the language used within the file is formal or informal. It does this by examining different aspects of the grammar and vocabulary used.
New formal and informal words can be added to the text files "badLanguage.txt" and 
"formalLanguage.txt" so that the program will recognise these words.
Some sample text files are also available to test the program.

Text file containing bad words was taken from https://www.freewebheaders.com/full-list-of-bad-words-banned-by-google/
